How do I approach designing software?
Now that I have learned this skill I think that this has helped me gain a more in depth understanding of the images
that are on my screen. The process that I used to make my project was to make sure that I had all the components that I needed to make 
my 3-d scene. I think the way that I made the shapes and how I constructed them in the code allowed me to make easy and quick changes
if I needed to.

How do I approach developing programs?
First I decide what I need to have in the program and then I work my way up building the floor plate good and drinks. The milestones were very helpful to me as they gave me many of the tools that I needed to complete the final project.

How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?
Computer science can help me because it is the field that I am most interested in. When I started learning the graphics and making the shapes it gave me a much more in depth understanding of what is happening behind the scenes when I see and an image on the screen. I believe everything that I learned in this class can only enhance my career and further my learning of computer science.
